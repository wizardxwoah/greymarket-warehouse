### The most ==racist== thing you can do is give a shit about someone's skin tone.

### The most ==xenophobic== thing you can do is disregard cultural differences in ethnic groups.

### The most ==transphobic== thing you can do is refuse to educate people on the health consequences of those procedures.

### The most ==homophobic== thing you can do is silence LGB voices when they don't fit the mould.

### The most ==equitable== thing you can do is tolerate the perspective and experience of people from all corners of the globe.
Making room for disagreement is the only way to see where you might be wrong. If you can't argue your point, you probably don't have a good point to be made. If censoring dissenting viewpoints is your only effective strategy, you are probably the bad guy.

### If you want to be ==inclusive== and ==diverse== you need to allow complete information.
Anything less is a disrespectful to how far we've come over the thousands of years of civilization development. It is an insult to regress back to the dark ages.
