### #research paper topic list + summary of objectives

> [!info]- Are tight food regulations contributing to mass food waste?
> Billions of dollars of predominately safe to eat food is thrown out on a daily basis by households, businesses, and food retailers. This study would aim to focus on the segments where this is a result of expiration dates. This study would have a highlighted focus on a variety of processed foods that tend to persist for a considerable amount of time beyond their listed expiration dates. This study might also investigate incentives surrounding food waste as a practice to avoid lawsuits by looking at past legal cases. This study might potentially examine cross-contaimination laws that cause waste in production lines if data is available. This study would mostly ignore fresh produce and most dairy products.

> [!info]- What are the mental health effects of censorship?
> This study assumes humans are mostly social creatures who, despite introverted or extroverted tendencies, all have the desire to want to contribute to conversation or group activities from time to time, and who respond negatively to being rejected or denied participation in those conversations/activities. This study would aim to analyze data from western countries to find a potential link between Depression, Anxiety, Suicide, and Divorce rates alongside growth rates of Big Tech platforms that are infamous for censorship.

> [!info]- Productivity and Diversity Study: Does strong correlation exist, is there statistical evidence for causation, if so are they positive or negative?
> - 1] Productivity and Ethnic Diversity in workplace teams. 
> - 2] Productivity and Cultural Diveristy in workplace teams. 
> - 3] Productivity and Personality/Emotional Diversity in workplace teams. 
> - 4] Productivity and Socioeconomic Diversity in workplace teams.

> [!info]- A deeper dive into the United Kingdom's cost of living crisis.
> Expand on the findings of *Markets and Growth in Early Modern Europe* (Routledge, 2012) and *A Millennium of UK Data* (Thomas, R and Dimsdale, N, 2017). This study would use data from the Bank of England's OBRA dataset and the UK's Office for National Statistics. This study would expand on <a href="https://www.magzter.com/stories/education/BBC-History-UK/HARD-TIMES-WHAT-CENTURIES-OF-COSTOFLIVING-CRISES-REVEAL">Victoria Bateman's</a> article which references the same source information. This study would aim to drill deeper into the behavioral analysis of food riots, and aim to calculate the ideal food price proportional to average wages that creates the most stability to determine a quasi-golden ratio.

> [!info]- Mathematically Debunking the Soft-on-Crime Approach
> This study aims to capitalize off the recent success of Bukele's crackdown on gang activity, and the rise of crime in U.S. urban centers that have adopted soft-on-crime policy. This study aims to prove that broken windows policing, overly generalized rehabilitive approaches, cooperation with crime syndicates, and the philosophy that "poverty breeds crime" are all fundamentally incorrect and lead to worse outcomes. This study would analyze American rhetoric around "Defund the police" in contrast with 1990's U.S. three strikes policy. This study would aim to dissolve American racial rhetoric surrounding crime policy by incorporating international policy decisions around crime, including but not limited to: Tough-On-Crime approaches from Singapore, Japan, El Slavador, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, Qatar. Additionally: Outcomes of Insufficient Policing from Brasil, Mexico, India. This study will ignore failed states, data from nations with stable regimes is a more appropriate for isolating the control variable of crime policy. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd3HrbjaVMk">Source of interest regarding Brasil.</a>
