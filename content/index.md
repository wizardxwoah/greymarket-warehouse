Perspective is a valuable asset. It's only useless if your main goal is paying the bills.

It's not surprising we live in an era where your thoughts, and therefore behavior, are heavily monitored and policed. You could argue every era has had a bit of that, but the internet fundamentally changed the scale of the game. Everyone wants to rule the world right?

If you've drunkenly stumbled into this back alley, you'll notice the doors are always open to peruse the goods on the shelf. 

Stay as long as you'd like. I'll mostly write about #culture #politics #research and #tech. I might throw in some #oddball ideas from time to time.  

My contact information is in the footer if anything in particular stands out to you.
