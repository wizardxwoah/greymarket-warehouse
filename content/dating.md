# Tinder brutalized love. Onlyfans killed it.

## Birth of a new era

`2012:` One of the most disruptive uses for technology hit the mainstream. 

When Tinder first released, I'm sure a lot of people thought it was great. Now you could comfortably decide how people see you, and can see who is nearby. You could easily meet up with anyone! Surely this will solve loneliness.

#### Cracks start emerging

It did not, in fact, solve loneliness. Tinder and the 100's of clones that spawned off of the concept, tragically reformed dating into a fast food model.

Did someone give you a slight inconvenience? Don't bother getting to know them. Just browse through the other options of people who find you attractive.

Tired of your partner? No worries, just dump them and get a new one! If you're hot, you can meet up with someone new in a matter of hours! 

#### Problematic #culture

I cannot stress enough how much damage this has caused. What's the point of committing to anyone if at any given moment, either party can quickly abandon the other for a replacement? How could you not be walking on eggshells in that environment?

Not to mention the weirdness of seeing your friends ex's and people you know. God forbid you see your own ex. Ew.

You'd think it couldn't get much worse than that. ==Unfortunately, it did.==

## Mainstream degredation

`2020:` A brand new platform erupted onto the scene while most of us were stuck inside with nothing to do all day. One that promised "autonomy" and "female empowerment" for the opportunistic: Onlyfans.

As a sexual deviant myself, Onlyfans has tragically distored the entire dating and BDSM scene like no other platform. Tinder was horrifically bad, but at least money was not the primary expectation during most dates.

#### No free meals

Onlyfans corrupted the idea of two sexually or romantically interested parties from meeting up purely for the sake of meeting. I've used a lot of different platforms to meet partners. Around 2022, they all morphed into Onlyfans advertisements and self promotions. Nobody wants to meet up anymore.

Women monetizing their youth was the final nail in the coffin. Even for women who do not personally use onlyfans, the cultural imapct it's had has warped monetary expectations during dating. 

#### Conclusion

Tinder built a world where you became easily disposed of. Onlyfans solidified a world where human interaction for the sake of human interaction is for suckers.

Ironically, people are lonelier than ever despite the promises of technology bringing us all closer together. I guess isolation and depravity are what you get when you dimish the value of an individual to that of a lab rat, and then put whatevers left behind a paywall. No wonder no one gives a [[shit]].

The West built the interenet. Western society has had a lot of good ideas. This was not one of them.
